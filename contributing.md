# Contributing to Unshackle

Thanks for your interest in contributing. As a small utility, the future
development of this project mostly comes down to user feedback and
contributions.

If documentation is unclear, or if you would like to see more of it, feel free
to make additions, add examples, and so on.

Open issues for feedback, suggestions, bug reports, and anything else.

## Submitting issues and pull requests

As you might expect, we ask that issues and pull-requests are written to be
clear and descriptive. Include as much information as possible; the more time
you put into an issue, the more we will.

You are welcome to open pull requests for any changes you like, but they may
or may not be accepted. Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an
issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work. Changes should always
be accompanied by tests and documentation.
